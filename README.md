# Gravity-the-Game
A collaborative game of information, interaction and emergence.

At this point, this is just an attempt to kickstart a conversation, and possibly a collaboration.  Anyone want to play around a bit to help refine this idea and actually create something?

I'm assuming that this game would get built on Holochain (not only because I work on that project, but also because I think it would actually fit the game better than a "non-distributed" application architecture.

INTRODUCTION and OVERVIEW
Idea for a game:
“Gravity”

The game is about exchanges of information between various partners.  At every layer, it should feel like a dance.  Sometimes the player has to learn how to do a particular dance.  Other times, they simply need to find the right "dance partners." Of course, as in the real world, there may be many different dance partners required for a specific "dance" to persist. As interactions occur, time is experienced (a la the VR first person shooter game where time occurs with movement).  

Each player has the ability to “view” the world from the perspective of the highest “coherent” dance that they are currently able to maintain as well as any dance below that that is currently maintaining coherence.

For example, early in the game, they may occupy the perspective of an electron that is engaged in a dance that generates a Hydrogen atom.  Later, after that dance has been “mastered,” they can shift their perspective to that of the Hydrogen atom.  Later, if that Hydrogen atom encounters another hydrogen atom, they may percieve of the world from the perspective of an H2 molecule, from either of the H atoms that are participating in that dance or from any of the electrons, neutrons etc that are participating in lower layers of that dance.

If a dance gets disrupted, they may lose the ability to “perceive of the world” from that perspective.  

If some alternate “dance / scape” has replaced that layer, in a manner that enables a higher level to continue to be regenerated, then the player can re-obtain the ability to view that layer, but only after going back and mastering the new “replacement dance.”

As “perspective shifts higher on a particular protocol stack” the aggregate follow on consequences of lower level dances start to become visible.  One of them is the emergence of a build up of storage of state changes due to lower level interactions, this build up of storage gets experienced at a higher layer as an “expansion” of the interacting “dancers.”  This expansion locally gets experienced as an almost imperceptible shift in volume since all local dancers are expanding at the same rate — this is so with one exception — the various dancers would experience “massive” objects such as the earth “pushing up” into them from below.  This expansion of all local bodies at roughly the same rate appears (from higher layers of perspective) as gravity.  It would feel as if objects are being “pulled” down rather than being “pushed” into from below.

REQUEST
I’d love to do a brainstorm session to figure out interesting game mechanics here to make this game fun.

BACKSTORY and ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
After a chat with Paul Borrill where he mentioned that he had no idea what gravity is (despite having pretty solid mastery of quantum mechanics), I found myself doing thought experiments related to gravity for a couple of weeks.  When the thought occurred to me that “Einstein figured out that Gravity was basically the same thing as Acceleration,” I asked myself “what if that is all gravity is: acceleration. What if everything is accelerating towards other things, not pulling on them.”  This is exactly the kind of thing to dork out with Arthur on.  So I gave him a call.  After giving him a brief overview, he said “Have I told you about my expansion theory of gravity?”  I said that I didn’t think so, but then recalled a convo about a year or so earlier when he had told me about a theory that the earth was actually expanding — a convo that had led my heart to sink a little bit, actually.  I remember thinking “Damn. Every time I find a genius to work with, they end up being at least a little bit crazy.”  

Of course, now with my own similar “crazy take on gravity” I was all ears.  Art said, “the interesting question for me is: What might be driving that expansion?”  

Ooh! That IS an interesting question? Got any hunches?

Art said: “the one that I find most likely is that there is a building up of storage at some lower layer.  As that storage grows, it literally is an expansion.”

“What might be getting stored?” I said.

“I think it is some sort of record of state changes by various particles as a result of their interactions with one another.” He said.

“Interesting. Like memories of conversations that we’ve had being stored inside of us.” I said.

Hmm. That would mean that if a bunch of particles are “near” one another, they would each be storing information from each of those relationships, whereas if only a few particles were “near” one another the number of relationships would be less — exponentially less.  

In other words, if the density of particles was greater, then gravity would be exponentially greater.

Not being very familiar with the relationship between mass and gravity (this is amateur armchair physics, at best), I googled the relationship between mass and gravity and was able to confirm that it does follow this pattern. As mass increases, gravity increases exponentially.  

This didn’t confirm the theory, but it meant we couldn’t easily rule it out.

Relatedly, if mass is really about whether particles store up histories of the interactions they have with one another, then only those that do that would be experienced as “having mass.”

There are a bunch of consequences of this that I haven’t fully thought through yet, but it has remained interesting terrain for me over the past couple of years.  

Last fall, I got to visit an elderly friend of my friend Vijay in Boston who had done some mathematical proofs related to his own expansion theory of gravity.  He wasn’t focused on what might be driving that shift, but was more focused on applying existing experimental results (specifically regarding things like the trajectory of outer solar-system satellites) and demonstrating that an expansion theory gives more accurate predictions than a “pull based theory.”

Then a couple of days ago, during a chat with Sami Van Ness, we barely touched on this concept, and she said that this is related to loop quantum gravity and that she and Poprox etc are planning to work on this later this year.  Super stoked. I love the geeks that I get to play with.

Of course, I am still taking all of these possibilities as just possibilities, but do find all of this fun to contemplate.
